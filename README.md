# 🏘 AirBnb Lisbon Analysis

## 📚 Project Motivation

Lisbon is a charming city due to its architectural beauty and the strength of the Portuguese people who, over the past centuries, resisted the most diverse problems. In the past years, Lisbon has become a “top tier” on tourist destinations in Europe and, because of that, the price of real estate market has skyrocketed (just ask a resident if this fact is not true!). 
Besides that, in recent days, a friend of mine told me that AirBnb maintain a public Datatabase with some data about their accommodations, such as price, location, minimum nights to rent etc. 
With all this information available at one click, allied to the fact that I will move to Portugal in the next months, a feeling trigged me to analyze that Data to answer some questions.
